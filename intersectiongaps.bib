  title     = {Chaos Research of Vehicle Spacing in Signalized Intersection},
  year      = {2007},
  author    = {Quan Yu},
  abstract  = { The paper uses close-range photogrammetry method to collect the 10154 data records of vehicle spacing when 34 vehicles pass a signalized intersection. Through the research of the collected data, it shows that vehicle spacing varies as well as inclines to some stable scope. This explains the drivers of following vehicle cannot exactly judge the vehicle spacing and the drivers cannot exactly keep the strength of stepping on the gas. So the actual vehicle spacing always oscillates near the expected vehicle spacing and seldom maintains the expected distance. By analyzing collected one-dimension time sequence data of vehicle spacing, by using reconstitution phase space method and calculating Lyapunov exponent, the chaotic status of vehicle spacing when vehicles passing the signalized intersection is proved qualitatively and quantitatively. },

  abstract = {Traffic congestion is a significant issue in urban areas in the United States and around the world. Previous analyses have estimated the economic costs of congestion, related to fuel and time wasted, but few have quantified the public health impacts or determined how these impacts compare in magnitude to the economic costs. Moreover, the relative magnitudes of economic and public health impacts of congestion would be expected to vary significantly across urban areas, as a function of road infrastructure, population density, and atmospheric conditions influencing pollutant formation, but this variability has not been explored.},
